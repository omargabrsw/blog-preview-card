## My process

### Built with

- CSS variables
- [Clamp Generator](https://clamp.vittoretrivi.dev/) for CSS clamp() values

### What I learned

This project was my way of revisiting HTML and CSS concepts after completing a course. Instead of passively watching tutorials, I found that hands-on building helped me truly understand and retain what I learned. Creating something from scratch made the learning process much more engaging and memorable.

### Continued development

I want to finish learning JavaScript so I can start working with frameworks like React and Next.js. After that, I plan to learn PHP and begin building headless WordPress websites, since I work at a WordPress development company. Since I started, I've learned a lot about how flexible WordPress can be and how I can bend it to my will.

### Useful resources

- [Clamp Generator](https://clamp.vittoretrivi.dev/) – Used for generating CSS `clamp()` values.
- [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/@ElzeroWebSchool) – I learned HTML and CSS from this YouTube channel.
